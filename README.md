# This repo was moved to [sdk-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@multiversx/sdk-wallet) and will soon be deprecated
For the update you will need to fix the imports 

## For example:
``` 
import { UserSigner } from "@multiversx/sdk-wallet";

will be 

import { UserSigner } from "@multiversx/sdk-core";

```
